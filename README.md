   ### "I may not be the best but i aim to the be the first"
   > Through out my life i have faced many **difficulties** and **hardships** ,these have tought me many things and one of them is a term that    i quite like in my native language "puxar a braza a tua sardinha"(pull the flame to your fish), wich shows how one should fend and fight       for himself in this competetive world.

- ## 🛆 Multiple areas of Interest
   ### "A jack of many trades is not the master of one, but known in all"
   > Having multiple interesets opens many doors, this is so true that most long lasting relationships start by having a common interest or a     hobby. Besides, if one only focuses on one topic of life, he/she grows blind to the beauty of this universe and ourselves. 

- ## 🛆 Unwavering Will
   ### "The will of the man, grows as he does, it fuels him and makes him fuel others for their dreams"
   > Having a strong will is very important, but a strong will without good values and understanding of others
